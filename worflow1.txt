Here’s a clean and structured Workflow Architecture Document for your project. I’ve outlined the tables you described, their configurations, and the overall process flow. Let me know if you want me to add more technical details!

Workflow Architecture Document
Overview
This document outlines the architecture and table design for a workflow system that processes data from a source connection to a destination. The system involves pulling data into staging, user-configurable processing, and tracking results with Large Language Models (LLMs).

Tables Configuration
1. Source Data Table (Table 1)
Purpose: To store raw data pulled from the source connection.

Column Name	Data Type	Description
id	UUID	Primary key
source_connection	VARCHAR(255)	Source connection identifier
data_column_1	TEXT	First data column from source
data_column_2	TEXT	Second data column (optional)
created_at	TIMESTAMP	Time of data ingestion
updated_at	TIMESTAMP	Last update timestamp
Notes:

The columns data_column_1, data_column_2, etc., can be dynamically defined based on the structure of the source data.
2. Processing Tracking Table (Table 2)
Purpose: To track each processing task with LLM and store processing results.

Column Name	Data Type	Description
id	UUID	Primary key
reference_id	UUID	Foreign key referencing Table 1's id
process_name	VARCHAR(100)	Name of the process (e.g., Sentiment)
model	VARCHAR(100)	LLM model used for processing
user_prompt	TEXT	Prompt given by user
dynamic_prompt	TEXT	Modified prompt during processing
status	VARCHAR(50)	Status of processing (Pending, Running, Completed, Failed)
result	TEXT	Processing result (initially empty)
created_at	TIMESTAMP	Time when row was created
updated_at	TIMESTAMP	Last update timestamp
Notes:

The result column starts empty and is updated after processing.
Status changes dynamically during processing.
3. Workflow Configuration Table
Purpose: To store metadata about the workflow, including source, destination, and processing configurations.

Column Name	Data Type	Description
id	UUID	Primary key
workflow_name	VARCHAR(255)	Name of the workflow
source_connection	VARCHAR(255)	Source connection name
destination_connection	VARCHAR(255)	Destination connection name
process_name	VARCHAR(100)	Process type (Sentiment, Summarization)
model	VARCHAR(100)	Model used for processing
created_at	TIMESTAMP	Time of workflow creation
updated_at	TIMESTAMP	Last update timestamp
Notes:

Links all components together, showing the full data journey.
Can be expanded to include versioning, error logs, etc.
Workflow Process Flow
Data Ingestion:

Pull data from the source connection.
Store raw data into Table 1 (Source Data Table).
Processing Initiation:

User selects the columns and processes (like Sentiment or Summarization).
Populate Table 2 (Processing Tracking Table) with:
Reference to rows in Table 1.
Process details (process name, model, user prompt).
Status set to Pending.
LLM Processing:

Iterate through each row in Table 2.
Send data to the LLM with user and dynamic prompts.
Update the status to Running during processing.
Result Storage:

Store the LLM output in the result column in Table 2.
Set status to Completed or Failed.
Workflow Tracking:

Save the overall workflow metadata into the Workflow Configuration Table.
Track source, destination, processes, and models used.

                            +------------------+       +----------------------------+
Additional Considerations
Error Handling: Add an error log table to track any processing failures.
Scaling: Ensure the tables can handle high-volume data by indexing keys like reference_id.
Security: Encrypt sensitive information like source and destination connection strings.
Audit Logs: Add audit trails for updates on workflow configurations.

You said:
I created the workflow configuration table by with this how can I created the table 2 having the result what is the relation for this table how do I correctly use particular workflow for the process 
ChatGPT said:
Let’s break this down step by step!

Since you’ve already created the Workflow Configuration Table, we need to establish a relationship between:

Workflow Configuration Table — stores metadata about the workflow (source, destination, process, model, etc.).
Processing Tracking Table (Table 2) — tracks processing for each data row, linked to both the workflow and the source data.
Let’s design Table 2 with the correct relationships and walk through how to use it for processing!

Table Designs and Relationships
1. Workflow Configuration Table
Already created — this will look something like this:

Column Name	Data Type	Description
id (Primary Key)	UUID	Unique identifier for each workflow
workflow_name	VARCHAR(255)	Name of the workflow
source_connection	VARCHAR(255)	Source connection name
destination_connection	VARCHAR(255)	Destination connection name
process_name	VARCHAR(100)	Process type (Sentiment, Summarization)
model	VARCHAR(100)	Model used for processing
created_at	TIMESTAMP	Time of workflow creation
updated_at	TIMESTAMP	Last update timestamp
2. Processing Tracking Table (Table 2)
Now, let’s create Table 2 with the correct relationships:

CREATE TABLE processing_tracking (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    workflow_id UUID,
    reference_id UUID,  -- foreign key to the source data table
    process_name VARCHAR(100),
    model VARCHAR(100),
    user_prompt TEXT,
    dynamic_prompt TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Pending',
    result TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    
    -- Foreign key constraints
    CONSTRAINT fk_workflow
        FOREIGN KEY (workflow_id)
        REFERENCES workflow_configuration(id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
);
How the Relationship Works
Each row in processing_tracking references a workflow_id from the workflow_configuration table.
This allows you to track which workflow was used for processing each data row.
The reference_id ties back to the source data (from Table 1), ensuring you know which piece of data is being processed.
ON DELETE CASCADE: If a workflow is deleted, all associated processing rows are also removed — keeping your data clean.
Using These Tables for Processing
Step 1: Insert a new processing task
When a user selects columns and processes (like Sentiment or Summarization), insert rows into processing_tracking:

INSERT INTO processing_tracking (
    id, workflow_id, reference_id, process_name, model, user_prompt, dynamic_prompt, status
)
VALUES
    (
        gen_random_uuid(),
        'your-workflow-id',  -- Link to the correct workflow
        'your-reference-id',  -- Tied to source data
        'Sentiment',
        'gpt-4',
        'Analyze the sentiment of this text.',
        'Analyze the sentiment of this text using a friendly tone.',
        'Pending'
    );
Step 2: Process rows with LLM
Iterate through rows in processing_tracking and send data to the LLM:

import psycopg2

conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=yourdb user=youruser password=yourpass host=localhost")
cur = conn.cursor()

cur.execute("""
    SELECT id, workflow_id, user_prompt, dynamic_prompt, status
    FROM processing_tracking
    WHERE status = 'Pending';
""")

for row in cur.fetchall():
    process_id, workflow_id, user_prompt, dynamic_prompt, status = row
    # Send to LLM (replace this with actual LLM call)
    result = f"Processed result for: {user_prompt}"
    
    # Update the result in the table
    cur.execute("""
        UPDATE processing_tracking
        SET result = %s, status = 'Completed', updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
        WHERE id = %s;
    """, (result, process_id))

conn.commit()
cur.close()
conn.close()
Step 3: Query results for a specific workflow
Once processed, you can pull results by linking back to the workflow_configuration table:

SELECT pt.*
FROM processing_tracking pt
JOIN workflow_configuration wc ON pt.workflow_id = wc.id
WHERE wc.workflow_name = 'Your Workflow Name';
Why this design works:
Separation of Concerns: Each table has a clear role — workflows track configs, processing tracks execution.
Traceability: You can easily check which workflow processed which data row.
Scalability: Adding more workflows or processes doesn’t break the structure — just link them via workflow_id.
Flexibility: Add new columns (like model hyperparameters) without major refactoring.

        +------------------+
Tables and Relationships
📊 1. Source Data Table (Table 1)
Stores raw data pulled from the source.
Each record is linked to workflows through reference_id.
CREATE TABLE source_data (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    source_connection VARCHAR(255),
    data_column_1 TEXT,
    data_column_2 TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Example:

id	source_connection	data_column_1	created_at
1111-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-0001	s3://data-bucket	"This is a sample"	2025-03-14 12:00:00
1111-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-0002	s3://data-bucket	"Another record"	2025-03-14 12:05:00
⚙️ 2. Workflow Configuration Table (Table 2)
Registers workflows — linked to source data via reference_id.
Stores user selections (process type, model, etc.).
CREATE TABLE workflow_configuration (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    workflow_name VARCHAR(255),
    source_connection VARCHAR(255),
    reference_id UUID,
    process_name VARCHAR(100),
    model VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (reference_id) REFERENCES source_data(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
Example:

id	workflow_name	source_connection	reference_id	process_name	model	created_at
2222-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-0001	Workflow 1	s3://data-bucket	1111-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-0001	Sentiment	gpt-4	2025-03-14 12:10:00
2222-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-0002	Workflow 2	s3://data-bucket	1111-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-0002	Summarization	gpt-3.5	2025-03-14 12:12:00
✅ 3. Processing Result Table (Table 3)
Stores LLM processing results.
Tied to both workflow_configuration (by workflow_id) and source_data (by reference_id).
CREATE TABLE processing_results (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    workflow_id UUID,
    reference_id UUID,
    process_name VARCHAR(100),
    result TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Pending',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (workflow_id) REFERENCES workflow_configuration(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (reference_id) REFERENCES source_data(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
Example:

id	workflow_id	reference_id	process_name	result	status	created_at
3333-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-0001	2222-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-0001	1111-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-0001	Sentiment	"Positive"	Completed	2025-03-14 12:20:00
3333-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-0002	2222-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-0002	1111-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-0002	Summarization	"Brief summary..."	Completed	2025-03-14 12:22:00
How the Flow Works
Data Ingestion:

Pull data from source.
Insert rows into source_data (Table 1).
Workflow Registration:

When a user creates a workflow (choosing process type, model, etc.), add a record to workflow_configuration (Table 2).
Link it to the correct source data using reference_id.
Processing:

Iterate through workflow_configuration.
Use the reference_id to fetch the relevant data from source_data.
Send prompts to LLM.
Save the result to processing_results (Table 3).
Set the status to Completed.
Result Retrieval:

Query processing_results by workflow_id or reference_id to view processed data.
SQL Example: Query to Get Results by Workflow
SELECT 
    sd.source_connection,
    wc.workflow_name,
    wc.process_name,
    pr.result,
    pr.status
FROM processing_results pr
JOIN workflow_configuration wc ON pr.workflow_id = wc.id
JOIN source_data sd ON pr.reference_id = sd.id
WHERE wc.workflow_name = 'Workflow 1';
✅ Why This Design Works
Separation of Concerns:
Each table has a focused role — source data, workflows, and results.
Traceability:
All tables link through reference_id and workflow_id, so you always know which data belongs to which workflow.
Scalability:
Adding new workflows or processes doesn’t break the schema — just more rows.
Flexibility:
Adding new process types or models is just adding rows, not changing structure.

ChatGPT said:
Let’s break down how the Result Table will look when the user selects one column for Sentiment Analysis and one column for Summarization — processing row by row using the LLM. I’ll use a simple example where Table 1 (source data) has 3 rows.

How the Rows are Processed:
Step 1: For each row in Table 1 (source data):

Apply Sentiment Analysis on data_column_1 → save result to Result Table.
Apply Summarization on data_column_2 → save result to Result Table.
Step 2: Table 2 (workflow_configuration) stores:

The process being applied.
The model used.
The source data’s reference_id.
workflow_id to link it to a user-defined workflow.
Step 3: Table 3 (results) contains:

reference_id: links to the source data row.
workflow_id: links to the workflow.
process_name: Sentiment or Summarization.
result: The LLM output for that row/column combo.
✅ Query Example: Get Results for a Workflow
To fetch both sentiment and summarization results for Workflow 1:

SELECT 
    sd.data_column_1,
    sd.data_column_2,
    pr.process_name,
    pr.result,
    pr.status
FROM processing_results pr
JOIN workflow_configuration wc ON pr.workflow_id = wc.id
JOIN source_data sd ON pr.reference_id = sd.id
WHERE wc.workflow_name = 'Workflow 1';
Result:

data_column_1	data_column_2	process_name	result	status
"I love this movie."	"The plot was great."	Sentiment	"Positive"	Completed
"I love this movie."	"The plot was great."	Summarization	"A great plot."	Completed
"This is boring."	"It dragged a lot."	Sentiment	"Negative"	Completed
"This is boring."	"It dragged a lot."	Summarization	"It dragged too much."	Completed
"Amazing performance!"	"Best part ever."	Sentiment	"Highly positive"	Completed
"Amazing performance!"	"Best part ever."	Summarization	"The best part ever."	Completed

You said:
actually the user created the two process in single single workflow he select one column for sentiment and another column for summaraization in same workflow so in configuration table for that workflow the datas should be store lik this in json process :co.umn name .process:comun name by with this the data should be retive from the first table and exact process will ocuur and after one process the next process want to execute
