Workflow Design for Sequential LLM Processing

Overview

This document outlines the design of a workflow that processes data sequentially using LLM models. The workflow consists of three main tables:

Source Data Table (Table 1): Stores raw data pulled from the source connection.

Workflow Configuration Table (Table 2): Tracks user-defined workflows, processes, and column mappings.

Result Table (Table 3): Iterates through processes (like sentiment analysis and summarization) one at a time, storing results step by step.

Process Flow






Explanation of Flow

Data Ingestion:

Data is pulled from the source (S3, database, etc.) and stored in Table 1.

Workflow Creation:

The user creates a workflow in Table 2, selecting columns for each process (like sentiment and summarization). The processes and their column mappings are stored in JSON format.

Sequential Processing:

Each row in Table 1 is processed step-by-step â€” completing one process (like sentiment) before moving to the next (like summarization).

Result Storage:

Results for each process are added to Table 3 â€” first completing sentiment for all rows, then moving to summarization.

data_column_1

data_column_2

created_at

1111-aaaa-bbbb-0001

S3

"I love this movie."

"The plot was great."

2025-03-14 10:00:00

1111-aaaa-bbbb-0002

S3

"This is boring."

"It dragged a lot."

2025-03-14 10:01:00

1111-aaaa-bbbb-0003

S3

"Amazing performance!"

"Best part ever."

2. Workflow Configuration Table (Table 2)

Column Name

Type

Description

id (workflow_id)

UUID

Unique identifier for each workflow.

workflow_name

TEXT

Name of the user-defined workflow.

source_connection

TEXT

Source connection info.

processes

JSON

Processes and their column mapping, e.g., {"sentiment": "data_column_1", "summarization": "data_column_2"}.

model

TEXT

Model used (e.g., GPT-4).

created_at

TIMESTAMP

Time workflow was created.

Example:

workflow_id

workflow_name

source_connection

processes

model

created_at

2222-aaaa-bbbb-0001

Conclusion

This design ensures:

Data flows from source â†’ workflow config â†’ result tables.

Processes happen one at a time â€” no confusion for users.

All relationships are clear (with workflow_id and reference_id).

Would you like me to add queries for inserting/updating these tables or anything extra? ðŸš€
